## Machine learning Project 
### Goal:
#### Developing a Machine Learning application using Python and related libraries to predict the class of object labels utilizing ML algorithms ANN, SVM, DT, and K-NN.
We created a full machine learning application developed for CMPS 470/570 to classify human mood states from lifestyle metrics such as steps, sleep, and hydration.

### Tasks:
##### 1. Visualize signals
##### 2. Preprocess signals
##### 3. Design representation
##### 4. Extract features
##### 5.Explore feature distributions
##### 6. Design and create the model
##### 7. Conduct model assessment
### Data Source: 
### Steps tracker. Location = PA1

## Project Objective

To build an end-to-end ML pipeline that reads time-series lifestyle data and predicts mood states using a combination of machine learning algorithms:  
- SVM  
- Decision Tree  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Artificial Neural Network  
- Random Forest  
- Voting Ensemble
